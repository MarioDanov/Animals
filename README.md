# Animals
Animals is a game where you can feed animals and based on what do you feed them their energy lavels change. Hence, if you feed them with food which is part of their diet their energy levels will increase otherwise it will decrease. The game ends when all animals have 0 energy, so they cannot be alive anymore.

## Getting Started

### Animal tests

These tests check:
    If the animal is deat after it has no energy.
    If energy levels are updated with +1 when the food is present in the animal's diet.
    If energy levels are updated with -1 when the food is not present in the animal's diet.
